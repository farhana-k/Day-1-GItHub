Day 1: Introduction to Git

● Objective: Learn the basics of Git, including version control, creating repositories, and managing changes.

 Topics to Cover:
● What is Git and why version control matters 
● Setting up Git and basic Git commands 
● Git workflows: cloning, staging, committing, and pushing 
● Branching and merging basics 
● Using GitHub for remote collaboration


GIT(Global information tracker): Git is a distributed version control system. This is used to software development and Git stores the full history of  code
It is a hosting service for software development it is used for storing tracking, and collaborating on different software projects 
Version control system records all the changes made to a file or set of files so a specific version may be  called later if needed

GIT work flow:
•	Cloning creates a local copy of a remote repository on  computer. This allows  to start working on the code locally and later push your changes back to the remote repository
•	Staging allows you to select which changes you want to include in the next commit.
Git tracks the changes you make to files, but they won't be part of the commit history until you explicitly tell Git to include them in the next commit.
•	Committing is the step where you save a snapshot of your staged changes. Each commit in Git represents a point in the history of your project, along with a message describing
•	Pushing uploads your local commits to the remote repository, updating the remote history with your changes.

Branching and Merging :
branch in Git is a separate line of development. It allows you to work on different parts of a project without affecting the main project.
Collaboration: Multiple people can work on different branches and then merge their changes back.

Merging is the process of combining the changes from one branch into another

Remote Collaboration:
GitHub is one of the most popular platforms for remote collaboration in software development. It leverages Git  and provides a cloud-based platform for developers to collaborate on code, manage projects, and track changes.

Activities:
1. Install Git and set up a GitHub account. 
2. Create a local repository, make some commits, and push to a GitHub epository.
3. Practice branching, making changes on different branches, and merging them.
4. Recommended resources: Git documentation and beginner tutorials on GitHub.

Step 1: Install Git Hub:  Chrome _Download GitHub Desktop website _click download_ install _open download file _follow the installation prompts _sign in GitHub account
sign up for GitHub: visit GitHub Website _click on "sine up" _Enter details (user name, email address, create a strong password) _ Verify account_ Choose a plan (free or paid_ set up profile) _Start using GitHub _ Completed the registration

step 2: create a local repository: open GitHub desktop _go to “file” _” new repository” _file In the details (Name your repository _Choose a local path _ Optionally, initialize with a README) _Click  “create repository” 
Make some commits:  add a file (create a file_ stage the file_ commit the changes) Modify the file (Edit the file _stage the changes _Commit  the changes)repeat the process for more commits_( view the commit history)
Push to a GitHub repository: Create a new repository(signup_ select “new repository”_ choose a repository name and add description_ select whether you want the repository to be public or private_  click ”create repository”)_ create a file location_ check the current status_ stage the changes(git add)_  commit the changes(git commit)_ check the remote repository_ push changes to GitHub(git push)_ authentication_ verify the push

Step 3: Practice branching: create a new branch_ check available branches_ work on your new branch _ stage and commit changes_ switch between branches_ merge a branch _resolve merge  conflicts _push the changes to GitHub
making changes on different branches, and merging them: start the main branch_ create an  the first feature branch_ stage and commit changes for the first branch_ create the second feature branch_ stage and commit changes for the second branch_ merge changes from both branches into main_ push the merged changes to GitHub

Day 2: Data Science Basics

● Objective: Understand foundational data science concepts, including data processing, visualization, and basic statistical analysis. 

Topics to Cover:

● Overview of data science and the data science pipeline 
● Types of data (structured, unstructured) 
● Basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)
● Data wrangling and cleaning
● Introduction to data visualization
 
 Data Science Pipeline is a step-by-step process that data scientists use to turn raw data into useful insights. It starts by defining the problem you want to solve, then you collect the necessary data from various sources. Next, you clean the data to fix any errors or inconsistencies. After that, you explore the data to understand patterns or trends. You then prepare the data by creating new features or transforming it into a useful format for analysis. Once that's done, you build models to make predictions or find patterns, and you evaluate how well those models work. After the model is ready, you deploy it so it can make decisions or predictions in real life. Finally, you communicate your findings in a clear way, helping others understand the insights and make informed decisions. In short, the pipeline is about gathering, cleaning, analyzing, and sharing data to solve problems.


Types of data:
Structured data is organized in a clear, easy-to-read format, like a table, with rows and columns. It’s like a neatly arranged spreadsheet where each piece of information has its own specific place
Example: A contact list with names, phone numbers, and addresses.
Unstructured data is data that doesn't have a predefined format or organization. It can include things like text, images, audio, or videos, where the information is scattered and not easily organized into a table or structured format. This type of data is more difficult to analyze because it lacks a consistent structure.
Example: A photo, a text message, or a social media post.
Basic statistics : Understanding basic statistics is essential for analyzing data.

•	Mean : The mean is the average of a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding all the numbers together and dividing by the number of values

•	Median: The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

•	Mode:  The mode is the most frequent value in a dataset. A dataset may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all (if all values appear the same number of times).

•	Standard Deviation: The standard deviation (SD) measures how spread out the values in a dataset are. A small SD means the values are close to the mean, while a large SD means the values are spread out over a wider range.

Data Wrangling: Data wrangling is the process of transforming and organizing raw, messy data into a structured and usable format. It involves tasks like combining data from different sources, changing formats, and simplifying complex information so it can be easily analyzed.

Data Cleaning:Data cleaning is the process of correcting or removing errors and inconsistencies in a dataset. It includes fixing missing values, eliminating duplicate entries, and ensuring the data is accurate and complete.

Data visualization is the process of creating visual representations of data, such as charts, graphs, and maps, to make complex information easier to understand and interpret. By turning raw data into visuals, it helps reveal patterns, trends, and relationships that might be hard to notice in tables or text. This makes data more accessible and actionable, especially when making decisions or presenting findings. Visuals like bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots are often used to highlight key points, making data more engaging and easier to grasp for anyone, from analysts to decision-makers. Whether it’s showing sales trends, customer behavior, or scientific patterns, data visualization plays a critical role in simplifying and communicating data insights effectively.
Activities: 
1. Use Python libraries (like Pandas and Matplotlib) to load, clean, and visualize a simple dataset.
2. Calculate basic statistics on the dataset. 
3. Practice creating different types of visualizations (histograms, line plots, scatter plots).
4. Recommended resources: Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib documentation, beginner-level DataCamp courses.

Load, Clean, and Visualize: Use Pandas to load and clean your dataset, then use Matplotlib to create basic visualizations.
Calculate Basic Stats: Calculate the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for a deeper understanding of your data.
Create Visualizations: Practice making histograms, line plots, and scatter plots to explore relationships in the data.
Explore Resources: Use Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib documentation and beginner-level DataCamp courses to learn more.

Day 3: Understanding the Internet (Start to Backend) 

● Objective: Learn how the Internet works, covering fundamental concepts from client requests to server responses. 


Topics to Cover: 

● Basic Internet architecture (IP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS)
● Understanding client-server model
● HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
● Overview of APIs and RESTful services 
● Overview of backends, servers, and databases

Basic Internet architectuIP (Internet Protocol):
Think of an IP address like a street address for a computer or device on the internet. It’s a unique number that helps devices find and communicate with each other.

DNS (Domain Name System):
DNS is like a phonebook for the internet. When you type a website name (like google.com), DNS helps your device find the right address (IP) for that website so it can connect.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
HTTP is the set of rules that browsers use to talk to websites. When you visit a page, your browser uses HTTP to ask the server for the page's information, like text, images, or videos.

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):
HTTPS is just HTTP with added security. It encrypts the information exchanged between your browser and the website to keep things like passwords and credit card details safe from hackers.
Client: A client is a device (like a web browser, mobile app, or computer) that sends requests for information or services to a server. For example, when you open a website, your browser is the client making a request

Server: The server is a computer or system that responds to requests from clients. It hosts data or services (like web pages, files, or databases) and sends them back to the client when requested.

GET:
•	Used to retrieve data from the server.
•	It doesn't change anything on the server—just asks for information.
•	Example: When you visit a website, your browser sends a GET request to the server to fetch the webpage.

POST:
•	Used to send data to the server, often to create a new resource.
•	It can include data in the request body (e.g., form submissions).
•	Example: When you sign up for a new account on a website, a POST request is sent to the server with your data (like username and password).

PUT:
•	Used to update or replace an existing resource on the server.
•	Unlike POST, which creates new data, PUT updates the existing data completely.
•	Example: If you change your email address in your account settings, the server might receive a PUT request to update the information.

DELETE:
•	Used to remove a resource from the server.
•	Example: If you delete a comment or post on a website, the server processes the DELETE request to remove that content.

API (Application Programming Interface):
•	An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
•	It defines how one application can request data or services from another. For example, when you use a weather app, it might use an API to fetch weather data from a server.

RESTful Services:
•	REST (Representational State Transfer) is a design style for building APIs. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources (data or services) on a server.
•	A RESTful API follows certain principles, such as stateless communication (no session information stored on the server), using URLs to represent resources (e.g., /users), and relying on HTTP methods to perform operations on those resources.
Backend:
•	The backend is the part of a web application or service that handles all the behind-the-scenes operations. It includes the server, databases, and the logic that processes requests and sends back data to the client (front end).
•	It is responsible for managing user authentication, processing data, interacting with databases, and handling requests from the client.
Server:
•	A server is a computer or system that hosts the backend of an application and responds to requests from clients (like web browsers or apps).
•	It stores application files, processes requests, and sends data back to clients. For example, when you visit a website, the server sends you the page content.
•	Servers can be physical machines or cloud-based, and they run software that listens for and handles client requests.
Database:
•	A database is where data is stored and organized for easy access, management, and updating. It allows the backend to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data efficiently.
•	There are two main types:
o	SQL Databases (Structured): Use structured query language (SQL) to store data in tables (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
o	NoSQL Databases (Unstructured): Store data in a flexible format like key-value pairs or documents (e.g., MongoDB, Firebase).
 Activities: 
1. Study HTTP request and response structures using your browser's developer tools. 
2. Explore REST APIs like JSONPlaceholder to understand GET/POST requests.
3. Create simple HTTP requests using Python’s requests library. 
4. Recommended resources: MDN Web Docs (on HTTP and APIs), freeCodeCamp tutorials.
Study HTTP Requests and Responses:
Use your browser’s Developer Tools to inspect HTTP requests and responses. This helps you see the data being sent between your browser and the server, including headers, status codes (e.g., 200 OK), and content.
Explore REST APIs (JSONPlaceholder):
Visit JSONPlaceholder to practice making GET and POST requests. It provides sample data, so you can learn how APIs work by fetching and sending information.
Create Simple HTTP Requests in Python:
Install the requests library (pip install requests) and use it to send GET and POST requests in Python. For example, fetch posts from JSONPlaceholder or send new data to create a post.


Day 4: Introduction to Flask and Basic Backend Concepts 
● Objective: Understand Flask and create a simple backend API. 

Topics to Cover: 
● Introduction to Flask and how it works
● Setting up a basic Flask application 
● Routing in Flask: handling GET and POST requests 
● Creating a simple REST API endpoint 
Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python that helps you quickly build web applications and APIs. It's called a "microframework" because it provides just the essential tools, without unnecessary complexity, making it perfect for beginners and developers who want full control over their app. With Flask, you define routes (URLs) that link to functions in your code, and when someone visits a URL, Flask calls the function to process the request and return a response, such as an HTML page or JSON data. Flask is easy to set up, includes a built-in server for local testing, and offers great flexibility. It’s ideal for small projects or prototypes but also powerful enough for more complex applications. You can start simple and easily add features like databases, authentication, or form handling through extensions. Ultimately, Flask allows you to design your web app the way you want, with minimal constraints, making it a customizable and straightforward tool for building both small websites and full APIs.
set up a basic Flask application, first install Flask using pip install Flask. Then, create a new Python file (e.g., app.py) and import the Flask class. Next, create an instance of the Flask app and define routes using @app.route(), linking them to functions that return content, like text or HTML. Finally, run the app with app.run(), which starts a local development server. When you visit the app’s URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000/), you’ll see the response from the function linked to that route, such as "Hello, World!" in your browser.
In Flask, GET and POST are two common types of HTTP requests used to interact with a web application. A GET request is used to retrieve information, like when a user visits a webpage, and Flask handles it by mapping a URL to a function that returns the requested data. A POST request is used when a user sends data to the server, such as submitting a form, and Flask processes that data through a function that receives and handles the information (like saving it or performing an action). You can handle both GET and POST requests on the same URL, allowing you to display a form with a GET request and then process the form submission with a POST request.
create a simple REST API endpoint in Flask, you begin by setting up a Flask app and defining a route that listens for incoming requests. For instance, you can create an endpoint like /api/users that returns a list of users in JSON format when accessed. You achieve this by using the @app.route() decorator to link the URL to a specific function. This function gets triggered when a request is made to that URL. Inside the function, you use jsonify() to convert the data (such as a list or dictionary) into JSON, which is the standard format for API responses. Once the app is set up, you run it with app.run(), and visiting the endpoint will return the data as a JSON response. This setup allows you to easily build a simple API that can be expanded to handle other request types, like POST, PUT, or DELETE, for more advanced API functionalities.

Activities: 
1. Install Flask and set up a basic project. 
2. Create simple routes (/hello, /user/) to handle different requests. 
3. Implement a simple REST API with Flask (e.g., return data from a dictionary or list). 
4. Recommended resources: Flask documentation, Flask for Beginners tutorials on YouTube.

Install Flask & Set Up a Project: Install Flask using pip install Flask, create a new project directory, and set up a basic app.py file to run a simple Flask app.

Create Simple Routes: Define basic routes like /hello and /user/<username> to handle different requests and return simple text responses.

Build a Simple REST API: Create an API endpoint (e.g., /api/users) that returns data (like a list or dictionary) in JSON format using jsonify().
